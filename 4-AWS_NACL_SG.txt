NACL(Network Access Control List)
Security Groups(SG)

NACL:
--------
-- one kind of virtual firewall.
-- NACL for subnet level.
-- NACL acts like a virtual firewall for your subnet to control inbound & outbound traffic.
-- In one subnet you can have n no.of EC2 instances. 
-- can not have 2 NACL for a subnet.
Rules of Default NACL: 
------------------------------
-- it accepts all inbound and it allows all outbounds.on top of that we can add retrictions on i/b and o/b traffics.

NACL support:
-- have separate rule for inbound.i.e we can control i/b, by adding rules
   i can say allow this, 
   i can say deny this.
   i can block ip address 
-- have separate rule for outbound.i.e we can control o/b

-- NACL is statless.
-- Incase of SG is statfull i.e there is i/b rule that rule remeber what    is going out.
-- it will remeber what is going out and what is coming in.


-- Incase of subnet,    we can control i/b but there is no control on    o/b.
-- we can control what is coming in.
-- but we cannot control what is going out.
-- we cannot block ip address.
-- subnet can have only one NACL at a time.
-- Subnet associate with only one NACL.
-- Incase of Security Groups, Ec2 can have more than one SG's @ a time.

Rules:
Rule 1 Type   Protocal  Port storage source Allow/deny
1                                                                     Deny
2                                                                     ALLOW

How the rules are evaluated:
-- it starts from the lowest number.
  eg: 1 rule says Deny
        2 rule says ALLOW
-- whenever request comes in it will evaluate lowest number rule so here 1 is lowest rule then it will deny.
-- And it will not evaluate next rule. eventhogh there is rule to allow.

-- The evaluation of rules happen from smallest number to highest number.
-- we can control inbound and outbound as well.
-- source can be ip,subnet.

The best partice to give a number to rule
100,200,300.....etc. in hundreds the reason is we will a scope to put rule b/w 100 and 200.
1 and 2 to put rule its not possible.


SG:(Security Groups)
----------------------------
-- one kind of firewall
-- SG for EC2 instance level .
-- Every EC2 instance must be associate with security group.

-- Security Groups acts lika a virtual firewall for you EC2 instance to control inbound and outbound traffic.

In Ec2 
---------
3 layers of securities.
1)  id password of your ec2 inst
2)  sg
3)  NACL


all public ec2 instance will get internet.
but what about private ec2 instance to the get internet for some reasons like security updates, every day patching...
